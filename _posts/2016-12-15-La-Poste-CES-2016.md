## BRIEF

La Poste wanted to express their new “connected services” positioning on their Stand at the CES. They have developed a bunch of connected services with their partners and they wanted something to demonstrate the usages of these connected services. We have been asked to find a way to demonstrate La Poste connected services on a 41 square meter part of their CES stand. They had three main constraint :

1. Thoses services should been demonstrated in a manner that show that they are real and concrete.
2. They wanted to have real connected objects that people could try.
3. Their partner should been integrated in the experience


## INSIGHT

Connected services are often presented from a technical perspective that make them look complexe and techi. To make the La Poste service feel simple and accessible we had demonstrate how it can be useful and concrete, insight : We believe what we see

## IDEA

Very Real, the first installation that teleports visitors to the heart of connected services of new generation of La Poste. A new way to offer a kind of virtual reality to a massive audience : the CES 2016 visitors at Las Vegas.

## SOLUTION

“Very real” will be an instalation that blur the line between virtual and reality to immerge the spectator in a connected object world were they could discover services that will change their life.
We used high resolution vidéo and screens that are connected with real objects.  Objects have real interaction with videos. For exemple when you put a object in the letterbox the postman (in the video) come to pick it up. It’s a kind of magic that make you feel that the video is not a video but a real scene behind a window. That why we decide to use 4K screens and videos.

## SHOOTING

The shooting used 6 X 6K camera rig. The post production was so complexe that Figthing Fish and DVmobile had to find never made before solution for handling it. The volume of data was huge and everything needed to be rotoscoped to correct lens aberrations.

## DEVELOPMENT / R&D

Synchronizing all the elements in a context were we couldn’t rely on wifi as the signal are usualy jammed in events like CES, we used audio cable to synchronise iPad, objects and videos. A taillor made sound synth have been developed to exchange ID between devices. Some object like the postal box needed a custom made connector to detected the opening and the closing of the box, we have developed a dedicated Arduino shield to do so.
