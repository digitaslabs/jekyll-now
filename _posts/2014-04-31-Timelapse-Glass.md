Timelapse is a Google Glass application prototype to make point of view time-lapse.

## IDEA

Go fast, fast, fast: nowadays this is our rhythm!
So what is the solution to share a slice of our day? Timelapse + Google glass is the best equation.
We really wanted to offer a solution for those who need to share a day story: a roadtrip, a skiing session, a marathon, a paragliding flight, or simply a walk ... By combining the Glass technology and the timelapse trick, we have developed a unique POV timelapse application: the limit is just your inspiration !

## TECHNOLOGY

End of 2013, Google released the Glass Development Kit (GDK) as a sneak peek for developers, GDK is a toolkit that allows to build rich application using camera, sensors and voice recognition. We made some R&D to setup a video timelapse application and we released a seamless application to take POV timelapses and to watch them right in the glass screen.

## HOW IT WORKS ?

### 1. Say the magic word "ok glass" and in the menu of Glass voice actions say "Start timelapse"

### 2. Once the Glassware is launch you can choose between recording a video or watching existing videos

### 3. During the recording you can see the number of recorded frames and you can stop the recording by tapping the touchpad

### 4. If you choose to watch existing videos you can swipe forward and back to navigate in the timeline.

### 5. For each video, you can tap the touchpad to access menu to then play, delete or share (coming soon) the video.
