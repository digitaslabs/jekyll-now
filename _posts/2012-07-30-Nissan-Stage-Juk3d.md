Nissan Stage Juk3d is the very first experiential platform using hardware accelerated 3D graphics rendering in Adobe Flash Player 11.

## Idea

Nissan Europe and Digitas/DNA, in their perpetual search for innovative concepts and technologies in the automotive industry, decided to build on the new opportunities offered by Flash Player 11. The pair created a new, highly innovative and impactful experience around the [Nissan JUKE](http://nissan-stagejuk3d.com/), the compact Crossover full of urban energy.

The user gets to discover the Nissan JUKE from any angle, inside and out. They can actually move around the vehicle, open the doors and get inside it to see every detail. They can personalize it by choosing the exterior paint color or changing wheels.

## Technology

Summer 2010, Adobe announced the beta launch of Adobe Flash Player 11 and its new revolutionary hardware-accelerated Stage 3D capability, which allows 1000 times faster 2D and 3D graphics rendering performance over Flash Player 10.
We get access to the Flash 11 prerelease and made some R&D to get the best of this game changer technology.
